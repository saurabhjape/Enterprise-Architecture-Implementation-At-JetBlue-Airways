------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:

This paper focuses on the various benefits, challenges and approach to implement a customized Enterprise Architecture at JetBlue Airways, which is agile and scalable. JetBlue is transitioning from being a young and growing organization to becoming a mature and complex organization and I believe this presents a good topic for me to research and work on.

This paper focuses on how JetBlue needs to reinvent itself in order to be successful, especially in todayâ€™s aviation industry, which is facing huge transitions. Having worked as an Intern at JetBlue Airways, I have tried to utilize my experience along with my class discussions and research to present this research project.
